# jTags
Originally a Template Override

When viewing the Tag Compact List Layout from a menu item, it is possible to show only the created date of the Articles listed in the layout. This is a project to create an extended view, where it will be possible to add the individual article's category and author.

An additional goal of this project is to connect to the Joomla Router to allow these new items to be linkable.

Once that has been accomplished, it would be good to add these as options in the 'Tag Compact View' admin.
